> Finger-sized 4K USB KVM for Server/SBCs

## Introduction

The NanoKVM-USB is a convenient tool for operations and multi-device collaboration. It allows you to perform maintenance tasks without the need for a keyboard, mouse, or monitor. Using just a single computer and no additional software downloads, you can start graphical operations directly through the Chrome browser.

NanoKVM-USB captures HDMI video signals and transmits them to the host via USB 3.0. Unlike typical USB capture cards, NanoKVM-USB also captures keyboard and mouse input from the host and sends it to the target machine in real-time, eliminating the need for traditional screen and peripheral connections. It also supports HDMI loop-out, with a maximum resolution of 4K@30Hz, making it easy to connect to a large display.
